VAGEN is a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework designed specifically for training Vision-Language Model (VLM) Agents. Building upon existing approaches for LLM agents like RAGEN, Search-R1, and Agent-R1, VAGEN introduces enhancements that better handle the unique challenges of visual agents.

## Key Innovations

VAGEN introduces the **Turn-aware Reason-Interaction Chain Optimization (TRICO)** algorithm which extends the traditional RICO approach with two key innovations:

1. **Selective Token Masking** - Focuses optimization on action-critical tokens through:
   - Loss masking (`M^loss`): Identifies tokens to update during policy optimization
   - Advantage masking (`M^adv`): Determines tokens to include in advantage calculations

2. **Cross-turn Credit Assignment** - Enables more effective credit attribution through:
   - Bi-level advantage estimation with separate discount factors for cross-turn (`γ_turn`) and within-turn (`γ_token`) calculations
   - Turn-level rewards applied at each interaction boundary

## Why VAGEN Works Better for VLM Agents

Traditional RL frameworks for LLM agents treat all tokens in a trajectory equally. This approach is suboptimal for VLM agents due to:

- **Distribution Shift**: Most VLMs aren't pretrained to generate image tokens
- **State Redundancy**: Visual tasks contain excessive low-level information in long-context inputs

VAGEN addresses these challenges by focusing optimization on the most critical decision-making tokens and creating a more nuanced reward structure across interaction turns.

## Experimental Results
Our experiments on visual Sokoban using a Qwen-VL 3B model show:
- TRICO significantly outperforms RICO in visual agentic tasks
- Both selective token masking and cross-turn credit assignment contribute to performance gains
- AICO (Action-centric Interaction Chain Optimization), which uses only selective token masking, outperforms TRICO on simple tasks
- TRICO demonstrates superior exploration capabilities on more complex problems
